# insertionsortt
[22,27,16,2,18,6] we use Insertion Sort
FÄ±rstly find the smallest number and swap each other.

2 is the smallest so our new lis t --> [2,27,16,22,18,6]

Find other smallest number except 2 and replace

6 is this number so --> [2,6,16,22,18,27]

Continue like that --> [2,6,16,22,18,27]

[2,6,16,18,22,27] And we got the solution.

Show the big O in insertion sort big o is n^2 so in this case big o is 36

Which case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted?
 Average Case

  Write the first 4 steps of [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15.6] according to Insertion Sort.
  [2,3,5,8,7,9,4,15.6]
  [2,3,4,8,7,9,5,15.6]
  [2,3,4,5,7,9,8,15,6]
  [2,3,4,5,7,8,9,15.6]
